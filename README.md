# Origins

Origins is an in-development web-based game about building
civilizations. At the moment its only a tech tree and isn't running
anywhere in production.

This repository contains a web-based client for Origins, written
using Vue. For the backend which makes up most of the game, look
in the [origins-api][0] repository.

## Running

Run the development server with

    npm run serve
